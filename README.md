# .JS-Quiz
A quiz predominately written in JavaScript where the questions correlate with particular solutions regarding the .JS environment.

A user is greeted with a welcome message that states the rules of the game; upon clicking the start button the timer begins decrementing, by ones, from a total of sixty seconds as the first question is presented simultaneously. If the user chooses a solution incorrectly their time will be decremented by ten seconds along with losing one point out of a possible total of five, one for each question provided. At the end of the game, the user is provided the opportunity to input their name to be saved into local storage so as to keep track of their learning process via .JS trivia. Post-juncture, they are allowed to restart the game, thereby beginning the process of the game, again.
